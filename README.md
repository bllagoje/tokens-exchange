# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
```


1. npx hardhat node
2. npx hardhat run --network localhost scripts/1-deploy.js
3. npx hardhat run --network localhost scripts/2-seed-exchange.js
3. npm start
